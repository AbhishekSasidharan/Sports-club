    Our vision is to provide a premier club volleyball experience that encourages players to develop their skills, identify personal goals, while fostering teamwork. We focus on providing a complete program experience emphasizing individual player development that will enable athletes to compete successfully on competitive teams and at the college level. We recognize the financial costs involved in participating in a volleyball club and will ensure transparency in how this club utilizes fees. We will provide details of the time expectations for training and participation in tournaments.

    Punjab is notorious for having much space but sports is where the city seems to make an exception. In the last few years, the popularity of ‘turf football’ has spiked dramatically and at Club Run, we are committed to ensuring that all of our members constantly have access to the best.

Club Run provides two football pitches designed to maximize your pleasure playing “The Beautiful Game”. The turf is developed with international level infrastructure and is a stellar platform to develop amateur and casual football in India. Special rates for Club Run always help!

With gruelling school and work schedules, social commitments, traffic and a host of other things taking up your precious time, we want to cut through the unpredictability to offer you something you look forward to and can rely on. 
</p>

<h2><u>Badminton</u></h2>

<p>
    Badminton has a rich history at Club Run and the club houses five courts in two locations with top notch facilities.
    
    The club has hosted numerous prestigious tournaments including the Premier Badminton League and Tata Open. Club Run also conducts and participates in several Members only and Inter-Club tournaments respectively and the courts have been privy to the likes of Indian superstar shuttlers Saina Nehwal and P.V. Sindhu’s training sessions.
    
    The main badminton room has three courts – two wooden-surfaced courts and one synthetic court. The spacious room is fully air-conditioned with high ceilings and space all around. Players get to feel and experience the game without any constraints.
</p>
<h2><u>Swimming</u></h2>

<p>
    The swimming pool is one of the biggest draws for any club – most of all for those in sunny Punjab. Situated in the Old Wing, the 75 foot x 40 foot length pool is your perfect respite from the blazing heat or if you want to indulge in a full body workout.
    
    The ultimate activity for both fitness and leisure, swimming is one of the best activities you can treat yourself to. The swimming pool ranges from 3.5 feet at its most shallow point to 11 feet at its deepest. The staff is always no more than a short distance away, attentive to your needs – whether they are fun, functional or safety related.
    
    The poolside seating area is one of the most happening areas of the club, with a seating capacity of over 100. It is not uncommon to see parties of swimmers lounging in the shallow areas of the pool, conversing with their friends outside who are enjoying refreshments from the dedicated poolside pantry.
    
    There are independent dressing rooms with appropriate facilities and abundant showers for ladies and gents. The club also provides towels and upwards of 300 lockers (chargeable) to keep your valuables safe. Members and their guests are requested to adhere to the Rules and Regulations of the club, posted near the register.
